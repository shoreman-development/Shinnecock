                <p>The Environmental Department staff work on behalf of the Shinnecock Indian Nation to protect human health by partnering with agencies at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as with NGOs.  The staff develop and implement plans to address the Shinnecock Nation's concerns in the areas of water quality, air quality, solid waste management, wildlife habitat preservation, and Climate Change Resiliency.</p><br>
                <h2>Water Quality</h2>
                <p>The Natural Resource Manager has spent years developing the capacity to create a water monitoring program.  Currently, the monitoring program consists of 5 sites around the peninsula and West Woods.  With the support of EPA Region 2 and the USGS Long Island Science Center, the department has a program that addresses the Nation's need for information on the quality of our surface waters and ground water levels.  The department plans to grow the capacity of its monitoring efforts and seek additional funding and other resources in the upcoming year.
                </p><br>
                <h2>Air Quality</h2>
                <p>The staff is currently developing a community outreach program to promote safer indoor air quality for tribal members.  Past projects have included providing resources and home improvements to households with asthmatic children.  The staff looks for opportunities to continue developing the capacity to serve the Shinnecock Community.</p><br>
                <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                <p>The Environmental Director continues to provide leadership and guidance on climate change resiliency.  The staff is working with other departments to update and improve the current plan that was developed in 2013.</p><br>
                <h2>Youth</h2>
                <p>S.E.D. values its opportunity to work with Shinnecock Youth.  We see this as a time to foster environmental stewardship, but also to mentor the next generation of leaders.  We offer volunteer opportunities throughout the year and paid internships during the summer. 
                    We teach them:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the importance of careful foraging</li>
                        <li>recycling</li>
                        <li>composting basics</li>
                        <li>gardening </li>
                        <li>botany</li>
                        <li>water sampling</li>
                        <li>horseshoe crab monitoring</li>
                        <li>Shinnecock Bay ecology</li>
                        <li>Importance of the human relationship to the environment and our interdependence on all of Creation</li>
                    </ul><br>
                <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
                <p>The SED staff work very hard to stay connected to the community.  We have 2 Facebook pages and host large annual gatherings.  Ohke Kesuk and Nipi Kesuk bring the staff, community members, and our partners together to share the work that has been ongoing, hand out information, and garner feedback to improve services. Some of our partners include EPA, USGS, The Nature Conservancy, the NYSDEC and Indian Health Services.  Our outreach also includes going into other communities and sharing our work.</p><br>
                <h2>Brownfields</h2>
                <p>"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant."- EPA Website</p>
                <p>The current inventory of Brownfields on Shinnecock include 5 sites that are actively being investigated.  A Brownfield can include site of opening dumping, abandoned homes, remnants of burned homes, buildings in current use with asbestos shingles and other sites of potential contaminants.</p>
                <p>The department works with a consultant to assess each site and go through a Phase 1 (documentation of visual environmental concerns), Phase 2 (soil samples, water samples, other sample collections based on Phase 1 recommendations) , Clean-Up of site (Dependent on future use), and Redevelopment.
                </p><br>
                <h2>Solid Waste</h2>
                <p>There is an Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan that was developed with the guidance of I.H.S.  The future goal includes having a small Transfer Station here onsite.  Currently, the department offers a recycling program that serves the community and the tribal offices.  Clean recycling can be dropped off at the community center recycling container daily.  The recycling is transferred on Thursdays.</p>
                <p>Accepted for recycling:</p>

                <h2>Sustainable Food Systems</h2>
                <p>The staff have several projects under the Environmental Department to support the Food Sovereignty of the Shinnecock Nation.  Staff continue to grow vegetables in Tanohketeaonk and oysters in the waters.  Through the Sustainable Food Systems, the department provides seeds to all community members who wish to grow food in their own yards, as well as other resources and information. Community members also receive the opportunity to learn food preservation techniques.  Future plans include working with Cultural Resources to teach traditionally smoking.  The staff also works with the local hunter and baymen to provide wild game, shellfish, and finfish.</p><br>
                <p>La Via Campesina defines food sovereignty as “the right of Peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems.”
                </p><br>
                <h2>Natural Resources</h2>
                <p>The department works with a number of local organizations and federal agencies to protect and conserve the land base and waters that support our natural resources.  Works include shoreline protection, wetland management, species inventorying,  and restoration efforts. Staff projects include building oyster reefs, shoreline plants, installing rain gardens, compiling an ongoing list of plants and animals that are identifiable to tribal members.
