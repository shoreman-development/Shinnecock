                <p>Purchased & Referred Care Services are those Healthcare needs that are not available at an IHS or Tribal Facility, and utilize an outside source for Medical/Dental services. Purchased & Referred Care (PRC) funding is available ONLY after all Alternate Resources, (Medicaid, Medicare, State and/or Private Insurance) have been used. PRC is the PAYOR OF LAST RESORT. This is NOT an entitlement program. PRC is managed in a way that care of the most urgent needs COME FIRST, based on medical priority/necessity.</p><br>
                <h3>There are five levels of MEDICAL PRIORITY:</h3>
                <p>LEVEL I: Emergency - Threat to life, limb, senses, e.g., auto accident, cardiac episodes. </p> 
                <p>LEVEL II: Preventive Care Services-e.g., diagnostic tests, labs, x-rays.</p>   
                <p>LEVEL III: Primary and Secondary Care Services, e.g., family practice medicine, chronic disease management</p>    
                <p>LEVEL IV: Chronic Tertiary and Extended Care Services– e.g., Skilled Nursing Care </p>    
                <p>LEVEL V: Excluded Services e.g., Cosmetic Surgery</p><br>
                <h2>Eligibility</h2>

                <p>A patient MUST have Prior Authorization for PRC Funding, or in the case of a true emergency, must NOTIFY their IHS Program within 72 hours of an emergency admission. For Elders (65 and older) or those who are disabled, there is a 30 day time frame from admission to notification of your IHS program.</p><br>
                <p>Referrals DO NOT automatically authorize payment for requested Medical/Dental care.
